## Security+ Terminology

Here’s an organized list of key cybersecurity terms:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
2. **Integrity**: Protecting data from being altered or tampered with.
3. **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.
4. **Encryption**: Converting data into a secure format to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Firewall**: A security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
6. **Phishing**: A cyberattack where attackers trick individuals into providing sensitive information.
7. **Zero-Day Exploit**: A vulnerability that is exploited before a patch is available.
8. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity before granting access.
9. **Authorization**: Granting permissions and access to resources based on authenticated identity.
10. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Using two or more authentication methods to verify identity.
11. **Malware**: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems.
12. **Ransomware**: Malware that encrypts a victim’s files and demands payment for their release.
13. **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: An attack that disrupts services by overwhelming them with traffic.
14. **Botnet**: A network of infected devices controlled by an attacker to perform malicious tasks.
15. **Social Engineering**: Manipulating individuals to divulge confidential information or perform actions.
16. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Intercepting communication between two parties to steal data.
17. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: A framework for managing digital certificates and encryption keys.
18. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.
